            <div className='text-primary2 items-center'>Hello there! I'm Sugam Gelal, and my journey in the realm of
            technology began at a young age, where my curiosity led me to
            explore the inner workings of computers and software. From tinkering
            with basic programming languages to diving deep into complex
            algorithms, my passion for coding has only grown stronger over the
            years. <br/><br/>For the past one and a half years, I've been particularly
            immersed in the fascinating world of React programming. Harnessing
            its power to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces, I've
            delved into crafting efficient and elegant solutions for various
            projects. My experience with React has not only honed my technical
            skills but has also fueled my enthusiasm for creating seamless
            digital experiences.
